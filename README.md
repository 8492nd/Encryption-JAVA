# Encryption-JAVA
Simple JAVA Cipher Encryption projects

The whole source codes are all set in one project now.

Each source has its own test method and main method.
Put your test vectors and, if it's possible, the known answer set.

This project is made to just specify the algorithm: this project is not suitable for real encryption project.
  - Actually this project does not consider the JVM environment at all! XD
  - As this reason, this project may can be renewed soon.
